Social Network Platforms made by Open Source Contributors

We see many bright ideas out there, we need contributers (coders and idealists) to make a free social network that will even become bigger than present social networks. We need almost all features to be available in amlive - trading crypto, private chat, friendship, dating, business profiles { including managing business employees, attendance, salary payments, HR etc), users can post news / stories and they may decide if such news / story is free or available for subscribers, Shopping ( shops to manage inventory etc ), Real Estate etc.. 

We want this social network to be FREE... if there will be ads in the future is to support the platform.
We want people to be able to create their educational profiles, companies to post jobs for free, merchants with businesses to post and manage their business for free. We may even create a coin that will be used in amlive.

We want contributors, we see many services out there are premium, e.g you may want to post a job to a certain site but you may find you are required to pay fees etc.

We need this social network, both in Smart Phones (using React Native), Desktop(using Electronjs) and Web(using Reactjs)

Best contributors will be added to board members.

Please Join our team and lets make this new social network that will make many services free of charge.

We need React-Native geeks, Electronjs geeks and Reactjs geeks to join this new amlive team.

We need to make almost all services available for free!.
